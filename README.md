## 🔥🔥🔥🔥 This is done using the firestore(for storing the data and Alglia for indexing).🔥🔥🔥🔥

### 1-> The basic way in which it can be done is storign the prefix of all the words on the firestore and the checking if it contains the searched words.

### 2-> So, to optimise the search function and reduce the storage I have used alglia for this kind of indexing.

### 3-> There are other search provider too like typeSense,Elastic and algolia itself.

### 4-> By this we can sync firestore and algolia for updating,deleting and adding the indexing of the data(Using Cloud Functions🌟🌟).

### 5-> Similar to firestore we can query for each search word and get the hits or basically the response🔥🔥.
